pacman -S xorg plasma plasma-wayland-session ssdm

// Then lookup for just the necessary packages from kde-applications group, and install them.
Here's thelist of such applications :

sudo pacman -S ark dolphin dolphin-plugins dragon elisa filelight gwenview kate kcalc kcolorchooser kdf kdialog kget kleopatra kmix kolourpaint konsole ksystemlog kwrite okular partitionmanager sweeper yakuake

(sudo pacman -S packagekit-qt5 is a package which helped make Discover work [cuz I was working with the minimal installation] )

Then, start the display manager, network manager, so that when rebooting, we're greeted by the wayland login screen.

After logging into the wayland session, some configurations and some customization I prefer to do are :

  Install Latte Dock from Discover, or by just doing "sudo pacman -S latte-dock".

   Now First, remove the Default Panel. Everything should be removed and we're only going to be left with the wallpaper.

   Next, we'll add a new Application Menu Bar [Right Click, Add Panel, Application MenuBar]. Then, add the widgets "Application Menu, System Tray, and a Digital Clock" in that order, with a spacer in between the application menu and the other two widgets.

   After that, the latte dock can be started, we can just search for it, and run the app, or run latte-dock on the terminal. Then, transparency effects, and wallpaper changes, size changes for the dock, and everything can be carried out.

   Some Changes I make are :
   1. a. Latte Dock Settings :
           Under Behaviour Tab :
              Visibility - Auto Hide.
           Under Appearance Tab :
              Background : Size - 100%; Opacity - 25%
              Length : Maximum - 50%; Offset - 0%.
              Items : Zoom on Hover - 70%.
           Under Effects Tab :
              Length of padding - 8%; Style for Active - Dot.
              Shadows : Size - 45%; Opacity - 60%.
              Animations : Speed - x2.
           Under Tasks Tab :
              Actions for Hover - Preview Windows.
      b. Latte Panel Settings :
           Under Appearance Tab :
              Items Size: Absolute - 40 px.
              Length : Maximum - 50%; Offset - 0%.
              Background : Size - 100%; Opacity - 25%.
           Under Effects Tab :
              Shadows : Size - 45%; Opacity - 60%; Color - HTML : "#2d7bbf"
              Animations - Speed : x2.
              Indicators : Length - 8%.
              Latte Indicator Options : Style For Active - Dot.
           Under Tasks Tab :
              Actions : Hover - Preview Windows.

Next, Konsole [KDE's Terminal Emulator] Configuration :
    Go to Konsole, select "Settings" from the Application menu bar at the top-left of your computer's display, and choose Edit Current Profile.
    Then, Go to Appearance tab, click the already chosen default theme (Breeze in my case); and then choose Edit from the right side. Select the Blur Background option, and set Background transparency to 17%. Then, move to System Settings -> Workspace Behaviour -> Desktop Effects -> Blur, and choose the setting kinda option next to it, on the far right of the Blur rectangular field.

    Blur Strength - 5 from Far right; Noise Strength - 7 from Far left. [ Context = Left Side - Light, Right Side - Strong; and there are 15 lines, dividing the line into 17 divisions. ]
